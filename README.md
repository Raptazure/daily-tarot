## Journey of the Tarot

- Traditionally tarot has been used for divination - as a method to 'look into the future'.
- However, a more interesting way to understand tarot - is a tool to unravel the unspoken voice of the self.
- Cards are something tangible on which we can project our feelings and thoughts.
