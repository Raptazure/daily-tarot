  <p>A pelican is perched upon an ocean post, illu-
    minated by a waning crescent moon. He pierc-
    ingly regards a sodden lone wolf, cast among
    the waves, paddling through unfamiliar terri-
    tory. Hoping for an easy dinner, he has fool-
    ishly swum out beyond the cautious trappings
    of his solid world. Gazing up at the stoic peli-
    can, the wolf realizes he has departed on a jour-
    ney that could easily result in his own demise.
    The Fool represents a new beginning, striking
    out naively on a bold new adventure. You may
    be filled with unlimited optimism, a feeling
    in your heart that you cannot fail. This may
    prove misguided, and in due time you might
    find your idealism tempered by painful experi-
    ence. So approach with caution: decide whether
    taking this risk is worth making yourself vul-
    nerable in an unfamiliar setting. If the answer
    is yes, show no fear: only those who choose
    to journey will ever discover new horizons.</p>
